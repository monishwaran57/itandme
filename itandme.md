Greetings to the readers, this is the journey of myself(Monishwaran) in IT field. Actually my aim was not to become a Software Engineer, more actually i was not aimed on a single thing and focussed on it during my school and college days, whenever somebody asks me about my aim, I'll answer them with a thing, which i got more attracted at that current time, some of the aims I remembered as said are, Pilot, Reporter, Lawyer, and even Prime Minister also in my school days, in college days with some maturity i said Boxer, Musician, Poultry Businessman, Typist, VAO(village Administrative Officer). But never aimed to become a IT Professional, eventhough I did my Bachelors degree in mechanical engineering because of my brothers advice.
On 3rd semester, my family can't afford my hostel expense of just 2500 INR per month, so i decided to go for a part time work, with some search i got a part time work in a hotel named "Friends" in karaikudi for monthly 3000 INR and then jumbed to a hotel named "President" a famous veg restaurant in karaikudi, during my 5th semester, In "President Hotel" i got 7500 INR(250 INR/per day), i have some good feelings for president hotel and have a good respect on it's founder Jeyendran and his son Kirubakaran.
As the time moved on and i'm in my final semester, i was in position to take a job to balance the cost of living of my family. That time 2023, lot of campus recruitment were planned to came to our college and most of them were from IT-sector, So our college Recruitement cell decided to provide training to students on IT-Skills, The course was also architected by our alumni(Rajendran) who is also the founder of Silicon Software Solutions at madurai. It was a 15 days training program on java, i joined that program and on the first day i felt i was far away from computer science, because in my higher studies of school i took maths biology since it was called as the first group and college degree is also on mechanical engineering.
After 15 days of training, i was so blank about java programming, but i need to learn it so that i can crack interviews, so i joined silicon software solutions on 10 sept 2022, It's a training institute for students to get placed in IT industry by our alumni that i previously mentioned, and also our alumni has a policy where a student can join his institute for 10,000 INR and our alumni trains him and make the student to get placed on a good package, after got placed in a company, the student has to give his two months salary to our alumni. I felt it's kind of a good deal and joined by paying 7000 INR(10 sept 2022) at upfront and 3000 ruppees on two(10 oct 2022 and 23 oct 2022) installments.
I was assigned with a mentor(Neya madam) from Silicon Software Solutions, who would assign me with topics of java and after completion of each topic, she assess me on the topic, if i clear that assessment, i'm qualified to move on to the next topic, everything was happened just online, i just learned topics by writing in note and memorizing it, since i was also working in president hotel, i came to hostel by 11:00pm and after getting freshed up, i studied for 1 to 2 hours daily, likewise 16 days went and on 27 september 2022, i attended the campus drive of jetzerp systems karaikudi, without completing the java course i enrolled, without having experience on writing programs, without a proper resume, i cracked the three round interview of jetzerp, the first round is group discussion, where they only expect the students just to communicate in english among the group, the topic of our group discussion was "AI technology and its significance", the second round was aptitude test of just 10 questions and the third round is a technical interview conducted by Shahul hameedh (Development Team lead at jetzerp) and Kannan Veerapandian (one of the Stakeholder of jetzerp, founder of VPKR Business solutions, brother to the founder of jetzerp),
As you know i created a note of the topics of java that i learned, all the questions asked by Shahul were from that notes only, i answered almost all the questions that he asked, after his wave of technical round, he asked me whether you are comfortable to switch your location to karaikudi, at that time, i had a feeling that i just got selected and got flying in my mind, afterwards kannan also started negotiating with me in tamil also about my change of path from mechanical to IT, about my family, everything went well and i got my offer letter to join Jetzerp systems on 27 September 2022, most remarkable day of life, That's how i got my first offer letter of IT Profession,,,,,
